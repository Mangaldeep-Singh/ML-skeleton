## Requirements

To install all the required packages, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note**: Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Set Gin as default admin theme

Instructions to set up Gin as the default admin theme.

## Data

1. Place raw data files in the `data/raw` directory.
2. Use the scripts in `src/data` for data loading and preprocessing.

## Usage

Run the main script to start the project:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

## Configuration

Configuration settings can be found and modified in the `config.yaml` file.

## Training

To train the model, run:

```bash
python src/models/train_model.py
```

## Evaluation

To evaluate the model, run:

```bash
python src/models/evaluate_model.py
```

## Results

Results will be saved in the `results` directory. Add details about how results are presented, e.g., metrics, plots, etc.

## Troubleshooting
